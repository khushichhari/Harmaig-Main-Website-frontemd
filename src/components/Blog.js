            A woman’s jewellery box is a reflection of her personality, holding pieces that she will cherish forever. However, it is essential to ensure that the contents of this box are well-preserved, protected from germs, and shielded from factors that could cause damage.
            
            Here are a few easy tips you can follow at home to keep your treasured jewellery clean and germ-free: '

            1. ** Avoid Wearing Jewellery While Washing Hands**: Wearing rings or other pieces while washing hands can dull their shine. Germs can also build up underneath them. It’s best to remove jewellery before washing and clean them separately.
            
            2. **Use Warm Water and Dish Solution**: For hard gemstones or solid gold, a simple mix of warm water and mild dish soap can restore their brilliance. Make it a habit to clean them once a week for optimal hygiene.
            
            3. **Soft Stones Need Special Care**: Jewellery with softer stones such as pearls, amber, turquoise, coral, moonstone, calcite, opal, kunzite, tourmaline, and emeralds can lose their lustre if washed with water. Gently wipe them with a soft cloth to preserve their beauty and cleanliness.
            
            4. **Silver Tarnish Remedies**: Silver pieces, known for their delicate sheen, tarnish easily. You can restore their sparkle with a mixture of lemon juice and water. Alternatively, a bit of toothpaste applied to the jewellery and wiped off with cotton can work wonders.
            
            5. **Kundan and Polki Jewellery Care**: Kundan Polki and Open Polki jewellery are particularly delicate and should be kept away from moisture. Use only a soft cloth to gently wipe these pieces, keeping their brilliance intact.
            
            6. **Store Your Jewellery Separately**: To maintain their shine, store each piece in its own airtight box or a zip-lock bag to prevent exposure to germs and moisture.
            
            7. **Avoid Sunlight and Heat Exposure**: Direct sunlight and heat can harm gemstones. Keep your jewellery away from prolonged exposure to preserve their beauty.
            
            8. **Keep Perfume Away**: Perfume can cause significant damage to your jewels. Always avoid spraying perfume directly onto your jewellery.
            
            9. **Pearl Care**: Pearls are especially prone to scratching. Use a soft cloth to gently clean their surface and maintain their germ-free, lustrous appearance.
